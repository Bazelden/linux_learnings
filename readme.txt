All scripts should be working as intended - the numberlist script. 

This is because I could not get the script to echo the sorted array, despite several different approaches and 
asking members of the cohort for advice.

I removed most, if not all of the code comments as they were very extensive and it was difficult to seperate them
from the code. Feedback on if comments should remain in code, even if they're simplified, for best practice would
be great as I was unsure. 

Overally, a very fun set of tasks. It look me a lot longer than anticipated as I struggled to wrap my head around
the syntax and due to the amount of shorthand calls, it was difficult to remember what a lot of things did.
